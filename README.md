# Simple UI

Simple UI is a lightweight and typesafe UI Library crafted using React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, and Storybook for streamlined development and efficient UI creation.

## Getting Started

We utilize Storybook as a platform to demonstrate the variety of components implemented within this library. To initiate Storybook, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies using `yarn` or `npm`:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

2. Launch Storybook using:
   ```bash
   yarn storybook
   # or
   npm run storybook
   ```

This will open up a local server displaying the collection of components and their functionalities.
